#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
d = "apple"
f = "apple" 
v = (d == f)
print(v)


#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
g = 4
h = 4
j = (g == h)
print(j)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
y = 3
c = 5
l = (c > y)
print(l)


#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
two = 2
four = 4
o = (two < four)
print(o)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
red = 2
blue = 1

r = (red >= blue)
print(r)


#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
green = 3
purple = 6
u = (purple <= green)
print(u)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
