#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
var = "my"
var1 = "name"

x = var + var1
print(x)
#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

run = 3
run1 = 4

y= run + run1
print(y)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

v = 7
v1 = 4

z = v + v1
print(z)
#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

c = 10.5
c1 = 7.3

f = c - c1
print(f)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

int3 = 5
int1 = 3

h = int3 * int1
print(h)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

s2= "victoria "
s3= 6

j= s2 * s3
print(j)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
g1 = 10
g2 = 5

k= g1 / g2
print(k)


#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
j1= 10.5
j2= 2.5

i= j1 / j2
print(i)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
y3= 6
f6= 3

l= y3 % f6
print(l)


#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
log = 8
log2 = 4

o = log // log2 
print(o)


#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
e = 5
e4 = 3

t= e ** e4
print(t)


#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

string = "victoria "

print("this is"  string)
