#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):
#Integer

a = 5

#Float 

a = 3.56

#string

name = "Victoria"

#boolean

a = True 
a = False 

#list 

a = [1,2,3,4]
a = ["Cat","Dog","Fish" ]


#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)
#Integer

a = 5

#String

A = "ITA"

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
#Integer

varB = 7


varB = 11

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:
#Integer

varC = a

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:
#list

b = ["a", "b", "c"]

listvar = b[1]


#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first item
#in that list:
#string

string = "victoria"

varD = string[0]

print(varD)

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(listvar)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors

b = 4
